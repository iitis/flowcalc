This tool quickly rewrites certain column values in ARFF files into other values, according to given
configuration file.

For instance, it can be used to convert the output labels of several traffic classifiers into a new,
unified set of labels---so the results can be directly compared with each other.

Format of the configuration file (dictionary):
	source1 destination1
	source2 destination2

Two exemplary dictionaries are available:
	dict-lpi2aggr   - converts results of libprotoident into aggregated classes
	dict-coral2aggr - as above, but for the CAIDA CoralReef port classifier

The dictionaries are not complete, i.e. they just represent a working subset of protocols, for the
author of this tool.
