These tools can be used to obtain the ground-truth protocol classification for PCAP files.

First, one runs toarff.sh, which calls flowcalc to find the protocols using DPI, and compute some
statistics, etc. on the flows.

Second, one can run lpifix.sh, which will apply some hand-made heuristics to correct the
classification results of libprotoident.
