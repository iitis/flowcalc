These tools can be used to obtain the ground-truth protocol classification for PCAP files.

First, one runs toarff.sh, which accepts uncompressed PCAP on its standard input, and outputs
uncompressed PCAP on its standard output---but with all packet headers chopped, up to (and not
including) the IP header.

Second, one can run lpifix.sh, which will apply some hand-made heuristics to correct the
classification results of libprotoident.
