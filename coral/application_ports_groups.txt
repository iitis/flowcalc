   CoralReef Application Groups

     The CoralReef Software Suite provides default application groups for use
     by those who seek to classify various types of monitored traffic in
     broader classes than individual applications. CoralReef version 3.6 is
     the first to use these groups in the Application_ports_Master.txt file
     for use with the AppPorts.pm Perl module.

     This file describes a hierarchical application classification scheme
     developed at CAIDA. Only the top level of classification is currently
     available in the Application_ports_Master.txt file. The ability to
     access the complete classification hierarchy through the AppPorts.pm
     Perl module is planned for a future release of CoralReef.

     To create our application list, we began with the IANA assigned port
     numbers and then sought to identify applications generating unexpected
     volumes of traffic on a particular port. It is by no means a definitive
     list detailing all applications used on all ports on the Internet. The
     prevalence of applications that run on any port introduces error into
     any port-based identification system, so the matches suggested should be
     validated using other traffic dynamics or packet payloads of accuracy of
     the application:port mappings is important.

     For tracking overall trends in Internet usage (for research, future
     planning, network provisioning, new service development, etc.) it can be
     useful to look beyond the individual applications (which can quickly be
     adopted by large groups of users and then abandoned as soon as something
     better comes along) and instead focus on the general activity a given
     application represents. This document describes the categories we have
     developed and lists the applications currently identified via our
     Application_ports_Master.txt file.

     We welcome additions to our list of applications. Please email
     Application_ports_Master.txt record contributions to
     coral-info@caida.org.

         applications that are used for delivering live content (audio,
         video, etc.) streams.

          * rtsp
          * shoutcast
     * Tunneling

         applications that tunnel traffic from one place to another. Many
         Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) fall into this category. In some
         cases it may be possible to further dissect the tunneled packet to
         uncover the original application, but with many tunneling
         applications, transmitted data is encrypted or otherwise obscured.

          * https
          * squid
          * squid_icp
     * Other

         applications that are not described by any other application
         category. As subgroups grow to contain a larger numbers of
         applications with increased traffic prevalence, they may be promoted
         to become new top-level categories.
