   CoralReef Application Data Files

     The CoralReef Software Suite includes a number of applications that
     require external data in order to perform such tasks as mapping TCP and
     UDP port numbers to applications or finding the name of a country given
     its ISO or FIPS country code. While all of these applications give the
     user the option of using their own data file, complete data files are
     also provided so that users who are satisfied with the default files can
     use these CoralReef applications without any additional hassle. Between
     CoralReef releases the data contained in these files may change, so we
     strongly suggest that users verify that the data files are up-to-date
     before using them.

   Documentation
     * AppPorts.pm
          * Application_ports_Master.txt

            The Application_ports_Master.txt file contains all of the rules
            that the AppPorts.pm module needs to map a TCP or UDP port or an
            ICMP type and code to a network application. The file consists of
            lists of records from which AppPorts.pm can select a match. For a
            complete list of the applications matched in our default file,
            please refer to the application groups documentation. Each
            application record contains the following fields:

                 description (required)
                         the full name of the application

                 name (required)
                         a unique name to identify the application; must be
                         able to be used as a UNIX filename.

                 group (optional)

                         a category for organizing applications, possibly in
                         directory structures, or for aggregating simular
                         applications. must be able to be used as a UNIX
                         filename. defaults to an empty string.

                         Note: The group names used in
                         Application_ports_Master.txt have changed for
                         CoralReef 3.6 and future versions. The new groups
                         are documented in application_ports_groups.html. If
                         you wish to continue to use the old groups, please
                         refer to Obsolete_application_ports.txt, below.

                 srcnet (optional)
                         source IP subnet(s) required for this application to
                         be a valid match. written in the form x.x.x.x/x;
                         multiple subnets can be separated by commas.
                         defaults to matching all subnets. the default can
                         also be explicitly defined as 0.0.0.0/0.

                 dstnet (optional)
                         destination IP subnet(s) required for this
                         application to be a valid match. written in the form
                         x.x.x.x/x; multiple subnets can be separated by
                         commas. defaults to matching all subnets. the
                         default can also be explicitly defined as 0.0.0.0/0.

                 ports_ok (optional)
                         flag of value 0 or 1 that indicates whether the data
                         has valid ports or not. matches exactly; for
                         instance, if ports_ok == 0 and the data's ports are
                         valid, the rule will not match. defaults to 1
                         (true).

                 sport (required if ports_ok == 1)
                         the source TCP/UDP port, or ICMP type, to match.
                         defined as a list of ports or port ranges, separated
                         by commas. the special character * indicates all
                         ports, and a port range is specified with a hyphen.
                         for example:
                            * sport: 123, 200-300, 4567
                            * sport: *

                 dport (required if ports_ok == 1)
                         the destination TCP/UDP port, or ICMP code, to
                         match. defined as a list of ports or port ranges,
                         separated by commas. the special character *
                         indicates all ports, and a port range is specified
                         with a hyphen. for example:
                            * dport: 123, 200-300, 4567
                            * dport: *

                 sym (optional)
                         flag of value 0 or 1 that indicates whether the
                         source and destination ports and subnets are
                         symmetrical. defaults to 0 (false).

                 protocol (required)
                         the IP protocol number(s) to match. multiple
                         protocols should be separated by commas. no ranges
                         are currently supported, but * can be used to
                         indicate all protocols.

                 priority (optional)
                         used for resolving two or more matching rules. 1 is
                         the highest priority; defaults to 50. if two or more
                         matching rules with equal priority exist, only one
                         will be returned. which one of the matching rules is
                         returned is undefined.

                 contributor (optional)
                         name of the individual who added this rule to the
                         file. important for tracking changes in analyses
                         that depend on port:application mapping. defaults to
                         an empty string.

                 date (optional)
                         the date when this rule was last updated. defaults
                         to an empty string.

                 notes (optional)
                         any extra information about the rule. defaults to an
                         empty string.

                 reference (optional)
                         source of information for the rule. very important
                         for assessing the validity of port:application
                         mappings. defaults to an empty string.

                 url (optional)
                         URL with the most definitive source information for
                         the rule. defaults to an empty string.

            An example entry for the World Wide Web would be:

         description:    World Wide Web
         name:           WWW
         group:          WWW
         srcnet:         0.0.0.0/0
         dstnet:         0.0.0.0/0
         ports_ok:       1
         sport:          80,8080
         dport:          *
         sym:            1
         protocol:       6
         priority:       50
         contributor:    bigj
         date:           1999-07-08
         notes:
         reference:      IANA Port assignments
         url:            http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers

            Note that srcnet and dstnet can (and should) be omitted, since
            they default to matching all subnets. The notes and priority are
            similarly the same as the default.

            If one wanted to override this rule with a domain specific
            application, such a rule might look like:

         description:    Our non-web app
         name:           APPFOO
         group:          INTERNAL
         srcnet:         10.0.0.0/8
         sport:          8080
         dport:          *
         sym:            1
         protocol:       6
         priority:       10


            It is possible to create a rule to match all cases, as a
            fall-through. However, it must have a low priority if it is to be
            useful:

         description:    Unknown TCP
         name:           UNKNOWN_TCP
         sport:          *
         dport:          *
         protocol:       6
         priority:       90

         description:    Unknown
         name:           UNKNOWN
         sport:          *
         dport:          *
         protocol:       *
         priority:       100

            The comment character for this file is #.

            Note: The group names used in Application_ports_Master.txt have
            changed for CoralReef 3.6 and future versions. The new groups are
            documented in application_ports_groups.html. If you wish to
            continue to use the old groups, please refer to
            Obsolete_application_ports.txt, below.

            See also: AppPorts.html
          * Obsolete_application_ports.txt

            Obsolete_application_ports.txt is the old version of
            Application_ports_Master.txt released with versions of CoralReef
            prior to version 3.6. The formatting of
            Obsolete_application_ports.txt is identical to that of
            Application_ports_Master.txt; the only difference between the two
            files is that the group definitions changed for CoralReef version
            3.6. The new groups are described in
            application_ports_groups.html.

            Obsolete_application_ports.txt is included in the CoralReef for
            anyone who wishes to preserve the old group mappings.

     * Countries.pm

       Countries is a module that lets you look up information on countries,
       continents, and country locations. It is meant to provide general,
       relatively static information. It does not map latitude and longitude
       to a specific country, but it does map a country name to the latitude
       and longitude of its geographic center.

       The comment character for all files read by Countries.pm is #.

          * continents.txt

            File mapping continent codes to continent names. The file entries
            should be formatted as: "continent-codecontinent-name\n"

            For example:

 sa      South America
 eu      Europe

          * fips.txt

            File mapping ISO 2-letter country codes to FIPS country codes.
            The file entries should be formatted as:
            "ISO-2-letter-codefips-code\n"

            For example:

          * iso3166_2letter.txt

            File mapping ISO 2-letter country codes to the full name of the
            country. A name in parentheses indicates an alternate name for
            that country. A name in square brackets indicates an optional
            addition (usually a prefix) to the existing name. The file
            entries should be formatted as:
            "ISO-2-letter-codecountry-full-name\n"

            For example:

 uy      Uruguay
